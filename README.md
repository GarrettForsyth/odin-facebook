# Odin-Facebook

See the results [here](https://aqueous-plains-68780.herokuapp.com).

This app aims to emulate some of the fundamental features of Facebook.

It is the [final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project) for the [Ruby on Rails component](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails) of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Some features this app includes:

- User account activation and confirmation through email
- Password reset through email
- User sessions and a 'remember me' option
- Friend requests
- Notifications when a user receives a friend request or when the user's post is commented on
- A user can create posts. Post may contain uploaded images
- A user can comment on friend's posts
- Posts and comments can be liked or disliked
- Users get a timeline page which displays the latest post of that user and their friends
- Users get a profile page that displays either their gravatar image, or uploaded image of their choosing, along with their profile information (contact info and an about me section) and their friends
- Long lists are paginated
- Allows sign in through Omniauth
- Sends a welcome email

In the future, I wish to improve this project by enhancing the styling and adding javascript.
